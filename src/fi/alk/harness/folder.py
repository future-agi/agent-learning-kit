"""A scenario as a folder of files, and running the code inside it.

A scenario used to be a row in one big JSON file, and its setup was a list of rows to insert.
That was enough while every world was a database. It stopped being enough the moment a world
could hold a service as well as a table: "the weather service starts returning errors" is not
expressible as rows, and neither is "the file is missing" or "the queue is backed up".

So a scenario owns a folder, and the parts that are logic are files:

    scenarios/<name>/
        scenario.json     what it is: instruction, solution, which sub-goals
        setup.py          def setup(world)  — the changes this scenario makes
        ready.py          def ready(world)  — is the world ready for this scenario
        checks/<goal>.py  def check(world, calls) — one per deterministic sub-goal

The files are the artifact, not a rendering of one. Each is executable on its own, so a check
can be run by hand against what a run left behind and answer exactly what it answers inside the
harness. That is the whole point of them being files: something you can open, read and run is
something you can argue with.
