"""The Claude Code backend: the loop this harness grew up on.

Adapts the neutral ``SessionSpec`` to ``ClaudeAgentOptions`` exactly the way the stages built
them before the seam existed: same gate hooks, same permission callback, same provider env,
same disallowed list. With ``ALK_HARNESS`` unset this backend runs, so nothing here may drift
from what the stages did on their own.

Claude Code supplies Read/Glob/Grep and AskUserQuestion itself, so builtins are granted by
