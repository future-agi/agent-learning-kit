"""A harness backend that runs stages on Gemini through Vertex AI, on Google's ADK.

The Agent Development Kit is Google's counterpart to the Claude Agent SDK: it owns the agentic
loop, executes tools, and holds session history, the way this harness expects a backend to. We
adapt at the same seam as the Claude backend and nothing more: a ``ToolSpec`` becomes an ADK
tool through ADK's own extension point (``BaseTool`` with an explicit declaration), and ADK's
event stream is translated into the neutral reply vocabulary. The loop itself is not ours.

The Gemini 3.x models this exists for are served from the ``global`` endpoint only, which is
why ``ALK_VERTEX_LOCATION`` defaults to ``global`` rather than to a region. Regional Vertex
deployments of older models can point it elsewhere.

Read, Glob and Grep come from files.py when a stage grants them. AskUserQuestion is not
implemented here yet: unattended runs never use it, and an attended run on this backend simply
proceeds without the option, which is said out loud in the session rather than hidden.
