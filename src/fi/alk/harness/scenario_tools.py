"""The tools that write scenarios, and the gates that decide one may be kept.

A scenario is accepted by being *proved*, not by looking right. ``submit_scenario`` puts it
through three gates, in order: the world must end up holding what the scenario presumes, the
reference solution must pass the scenario's own checks, and those same checks must fail when
nothing is done at all.

Every gate is code. No model is asked whether a scenario is good; the environment decides. A
scenario that clears all three is written out as its own folder of runnable files.
