# Agent Learning Kit Development Boundary

`agent-learning-kit` is the public SDK and code home for agent simulation,
evaluation, red teaming, and optimization.

All new public SDK work should land here first:

- Public Python imports belong under `fi.alk.*`.
- Public TypeScript package work belongs under `typescript/agent-learning-kit`
  and publishes as `@future-agi/agent-learning-kit`.
- Public CLI commands belong under `agent-learn`.
- Public examples and cookbooks should use `agent-learning-kit` install commands.
- Runtime implementation should live under this repo, either in
  `fi.alk.*` for public APIs or vendored `fi.*` engine packages while
  migration is in progress.
- Shared configuration and keys should flow through `fi.alk.configure()`
  and `AGENT_LEARNING_*` environment variables. Vendored engine aliases
  (`FI_API_KEY`, `FI_SECRET_KEY`, and Future AGI variants) are synced from that
  public config for compatibility only; new public code should not introduce a
  separate key model.

`ai-evaluation` is an active engine for this release, not legacy history. Its
Python runtime must be present under `src/fi/evals`, and its TypeScript SDK
source must be present under `typescript/agent-learning-kit/src`.
`agent-learn release-check` compares those source trees with
the ai-evaluation source inventory (maintained in the internal-docs repo) so missing ai-evaluation
files fail the v1 release gate.

The older `simulate-sdk` and `agent-opt` repositories are source/history during
the migration. New runtime code should be moved into `agent-learning-kit`, not
merely wrapped here. If a fix must first land in an old repo to stabilize an
engine, copy the verified implementation into this repo before treating the
public SDK work as done.

For the current source map, see [LIBRARIES.md](LIBRARIES.md). In short:

- `ai-evaluation` lives under `src/fi/evals`.
- `ai-evaluation` TypeScript source lives under `typescript/agent-learning-kit/src`.
- `simulate-sdk` lives under `src/fi/simulate`.
- `agent-opt` lives under `src/fi/opt`.
- Public Python APIs live under `src/fi/alk`.

When moving an existing surface:

1. Move or add the implementation code under this repository.
2. Add or update the `fi.alk.*` API/CLI.
3. For TypeScript surfaces, add/update the package under
   `typescript/agent-learning-kit` and verify `pnpm --dir typescript --filter
   @future-agi/agent-learning-kit build` plus the package test command.
4. Verify it against real local artifacts and relevant engine tests using this
   repository as the source path.
5. Update public docs/examples to use `agent-learning-kit`.
6. Only then simplify or hide the older engine-level surface.
# Release pipeline

One GitHub Actions workflow, `Release` (`.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml`), runs
on every push to `main`, including merges. It publishes the SDK to PyPI, builds and
certifies the hosted E2B template, and opens a pull request in `future-agi/deployment`
that pins the new template. The SDK and the template run side by side; neither waits
for the other. Pull requests that change the release inputs run credential-free
validation only.

Keep the file name `publish-pypi.yml`. PyPI accepts uploads only from the trusted
publisher registered for this repository, that workflow file name, and the `pypi`
environment; change the publisher on pypi.org before renaming the file.

One-time setup:

- `E2B_API_KEY`, a repository Actions secret holding the E2B team's API key.
- `RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID` and `RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY`, the organization Actions
  secrets of the release bot GitHub App, shared with this repository. The app must
  be installed on `future-agi/deployment` with write access to contents and pull
  requests.
- The PyPI trusted publisher above, and reviewers on the `pypi` environment.
- GHCR: the workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write` to push to
  `ghcr.io/future-agi/agent-learning-kit/alk-hosted-runtime`, and supplies that
  short-lived credential to the E2B builder for the image import. No Docker Hub
  credential is needed. Organization policy must permit the repository to create
  GHCR packages; if the package already exists, grant this repository Actions access
  in its package settings. See GitHub's
  [Container registry documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

## SDK

The SDK is uploaded only when the `version` in `pyproject.toml` is not on PyPI yet.
To release: bump `version`, run `uv lock`, merge, then approve the `pypi` environment
deployment. The upload runs on pushes only, never on a manual run.

## E2B template

The workflow runs `scripts/e2b-template.py` against the checked-out commit. It builds
`Dockerfile.hosted` for Linux amd64, pushes a uniquely tagged image, imports its
immutable digest into `alk-hosted-<12-character commit SHA>`, and certifies the
capabilities in `hosted-snapshot/catalog.json` in a temporary sandbox. The existing
publisher defaults apply: 4 CPUs, 8192 MB RAM, and at least 10 GB verified disk.
The publisher cleans up its certification sandbox when the check finishes.

A successful run exposes the immutable `template-name:build-id` reference in the
job summary and saves `e2b-template-release.json` as a 90-day workflow artifact.
That file includes the source commit, image digest, resource sizes, and certification
results. A failed certification fails the job and produces no certified release
artifact; its image/template may already exist, so use only successful releases.

Each commit has its own concurrency group, so a newer merge does not cancel or
replace an older commit's publication. Reruns of the same commit are serialized.
Reruns create a new image tag and E2B build; always use the immutable reference
from the desired run. To build a template without a merge, use
**Actions → Release → Run workflow** and select `main`.

## Deployment pull request

After a template is certified, the workflow opens a pull request against `main` of
`future-agi/deployment` as `futureagi-release-bot`, on the branch
`chore/harness-pin-<template name>`. `scripts/bump_deployment_values.py` edits
`us/gcp/deployment/values.yaml` and `eu/gcp/deployment/values.yaml`: every
`ALK_E2B_TEMPLATE_REFERENCE`, `ALK_E2B_TEMPLATE_BUILD_ID`,
`ALK_E2B_TEMPLATE_CPU_UNITS`, `ALK_E2B_TEMPLATE_MEMORY_MB` and
`ALK_E2B_TEMPLATE_DISK_GB` is set from the certified release, and where
`HARNESS_PARALLEL_SNAPSHOT_DIGESTS` lists the previous build ID it is swapped for the
new one. No other line changes.

The workflow never merges the pull request and never moves a production alias; a
person reviews and merges it. If a setting is missing from a values file, appears a
different number of times than the others, or is written in a form the script cannot
rewrite safely, the job fails and neither file is changed. No certified template
means no pull request. A rerun for the same commit updates the same pull request.
Pull requests opened for older commits are not closed automatically.
